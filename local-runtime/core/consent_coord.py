"""The consent state machine, split out of the wire session.

``LocalConsentCoordinator`` owns every on-device and relayed consent request —
the pending tables, the prompt wait, the answers and the audit rows that prove
what happened to each. The session (``LocalRuntimeClient``) keeps the wire: it
sends frames, tracks running tasks and owns teardown. The two talk through a
small protocol rather than a hard import, so the coordinator stays testable
without a socket.
